# Autosplitter Scripts for LiveSplit
## Tomb Raider II
 - Supports all known executables for full-game runs
 - Blank splits file available [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FluxMonkii/Autosplitters/master/Splits/TombRaiderII-splits.lss) (right-click, save as)

Note: This splitter is no longer directly available in LiveSplit due to [#380](https://github.com/LiveSplit/LiveSplit.AutoSplitters/pull/380) and [#433](https://github.com/LiveSplit/LiveSplit.AutoSplitters/pull/433) - no attempt was made to contact me to discuss anything, but feel free to download and use it the good 'ol fashioned way if the new fangled one doesn't work for you. ðŸ™ƒ
## Tomb Raider: Legend
 - Supports all v1.2 releases including Japanese for full-game runs
 - Blank splits file available [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FluxMonkii/Autosplitters/master/Splits/TombRaiderLegend-splits.lss) (right-click, save as)
